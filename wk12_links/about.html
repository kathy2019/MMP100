	<h1>Jason Statham is a star of the Hollywood blockbusters, who is often called «the new Bruce Willis». The joint works with film director Guy Ritchie, who made him the protagonist of many of his films («Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels», «Snatch», «Revolver»), became a bridge to fame for the actor. Later on, Jason Statham also became an inviolable symbol of the blockbusters «Crank» and «The Transporter»</h1>

	<h1>Jason was the second child in the family of a famous lounge singer and dressmaker, who later evolved into dancers. The father of the future actor was engaged in gymnastics and boxing. So, he brought up his sons as real sportsmen</h1>

	<h1>The boy’s elder brother imbibed his father's love to martial arts and often used the younger one as a punching bag. Jason preferred water sports more, particularly diving. Moreover, in 1988, he joined Great Britain’s Olympic team at the Olympics Games in Seoul. Later on, the young man also has mastered kickboxing and Brazilian JIU-jitsu.
